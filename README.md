This app is for practicing the language you are learning. Select your native language, then select your learning language, then select a topic. It will then generate 10 phrases for you to practice. If you have learned the 10 phrases well, then you can generate some new ones. For text-to-speech to work, you must have the language enabled on your computer. To view this app, visit the github pages link in this readme.
